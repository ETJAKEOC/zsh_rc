# zsh_rc
My ZSH configs/scripts

This repo contains my ZSH configs/RC files.
The ".zshrc" file is from my /home directory.
The "compiler.env" file is a file I use to force my system to use a custom file that is a ccaached clang/++ (the /usr/local/bin/cclang).
The remaining files exist inside of "/etc/zsh" (as can be derived from reading the .zshrc)
